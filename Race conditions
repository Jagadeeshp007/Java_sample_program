Race conditions and other thread-related issues are common problems encountered in multi-threaded programming. Let's discuss each briefly:

1. **Race Conditions**: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the execution timing of the threads. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and incorrect results. For example, if two threads increment a shared counter simultaneously without synchronization, the final count might be incorrect due to interleaving of operations.

2. **Deadlock**: Deadlock happens when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they need. This typically occurs when threads acquire multiple locks in different orders. If each thread holds one lock and waits for the other, a deadlock occurs.

3. **Starvation**: Starvation occurs when a thread is unable to gain access to shared resources because other threads are constantly accessing them. This can happen if certain threads have higher priority or if they monopolize resources for extended periods.

4. **Livelock**: Livelock occurs when two or more threads keep responding to each other's actions without making progress. It's similar to deadlock but in livelock, the threads are not blocked; instead, they're constantly responding to each other in a way that prevents any of them from making progress.

5. **Thread Safety Violations**: This refers to situations where shared resources are accessed or modified by multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can lead to data corruption or inconsistent behavior.

To mitigate these issues, techniques such as synchronization, locking, thread-safe data structures, and proper thread communication mechanisms (like `wait()` and `notify()` in Java) are used. Additionally, careful design and testing are necessary to identify and address potential thread-related problems in multi-threaded applications.
